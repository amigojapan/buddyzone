# buddyzone
an app for messaging people near by, seeting up meetups with them and many other things

this is intended as a social app that allows you to send messages to people near by you, 
and also set up a meeting spot for you and someone else.
making friends is allowed but dating is not allowed, this is to prevent people feeling unconfortable with
people comming on to them. try using this app when you want to have a cup of coffee but dont want to have it alone.

this app is still under development, and is still not even under beta testing....
